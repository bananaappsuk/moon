Feature: Private Messaging
  Scenario: Private Messaging is useful for forums
    Given I am on the base Url nopecommerce
    And I am on the Inbox link the Private messaging is available
    When Private messaging is disabled by default by the administrator. this feature should be enabled by the following steps:From the Administration Area, select Configuration > Settings > Forum Settings. Ensure Allow private messages are checked
    Then I should see no errors on posting any messages on to the forums with PM highlighted.
